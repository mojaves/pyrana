~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(C) 2010 Francesco Romani < fromani | gmail : com >


Overview
--------

Pyrana is a python package designed to provides simple access to
multimedia files. Pyrana is based on the FFmpeg[1] libraries, but
provides an independent API. Wherever practical, Pyrana aims to
be as much backward compatible as is possible to the Pymedia package[2].


License Notice
--------------

While Pyrana itself is licensed under the ZLIB license (see COPYING),
the package needs the FFmpeg libraries, which have different licenses
(most notably LGPL and GPL) depending on the configuration.


API Stability
-------------

The API is unstable (= free to change without notice) until the
stable milestone is reached. The API WILL BE maintained stable 
in every major release.


Requirements
------------

python >= 2.6
FFmpeg >= 0.50 (the last SVN/GIT snapshot is usually fine).
