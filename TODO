* general
~~~~~~~~~
- TESTS!

* format submodule
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- {in,out}put_formats: a set() maybe?
- why there are duplicates in the former list?
- is_streaming broken
- Packet str() and repr() are conceptually wrong.

* video submodule
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- actually fill the lists
- ImageConverter is clumsy. Maybe another sub-sub-module?
