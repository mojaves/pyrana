Overview
--------

Pyrana is a python package designed to provides simple access to
multimedia files. Pyrana is based on the FFmpeg_
libraries, but provides an independent API.

Pyrana sets you free from the tyranny of subprocess_.
Without pyrana, almost every piace of code which wanted to use the mighty
FFmpeg, had to subprocess it. You had no choice.
pyrana provides an powerful, pythonic alternative.
If you *do want* to subprocess() FFmpeg, pyrana may be what you were looking for.

Pyrana aims to be the spiritual successor of pymedia_.
The Pyrana API is insipired by the PyMedia API, but being compatible
with the latter is not a main objective (yet).
The two projects share a similar objective but no code and they
are full independent. However, for the reasons just outlined it is
indexed and advertised on pypi_ as pymedia2-pyrana.


License Notice
--------------

While Pyrana itself is licensed under the MIT license (see LICENSE),
the package needs the FFmpeg libraries, which have different licenses
(most notably LGPL and GPL) depending on the configuration.


API Stability
-------------

The API is unstable (= free to change without notice) until the
stable milestone is reached. The API WILL BE maintained stable 
in every major release.
